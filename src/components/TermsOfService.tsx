        <h2>Disclaimer — Not Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>PassaroMangia is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.</strong> The 
          health scores, nutrition analysis, AI recommendations, and all other information provided by the 
          app are for informational and educational purposes only.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. 
          Always consult a qualified healthcare provider before making dietary changes, especially if you have 
          allergies, medical conditions, or are taking medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health scores and product analysis are based on publicly available data from Open Food Facts and 
          AI-generated assessments. These may not be complete, accurate, or up-to-date. Product formulations 
          change frequently — always check the actual product label.
        </p>

        <h2>Allergy Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Do not rely on PassaroMangia for allergy safety.</strong> While we display allergen 
          information from product databases, this data may be incomplete or inaccurate. Cross-contamination 
          risks are not tracked. If you have food allergies, always read the physical product label and 
          contact the manufacturer directly.
        </p>

        <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          PassaroMangia uses artificial intelligence (powered by OpenAI) to generate nutrition advice, 
          menu analysis, and shopping suggestions. AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, 
          or outdated information. It should be treated as a helpful starting point, not as authoritative 
          nutritional guidance.
        </p>
