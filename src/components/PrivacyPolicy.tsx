        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Ryva ("we", "our", "the app"), a product of Passaro Technologies LLC, is committed to protecting your privacy.
          This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Data stored on your device (local only)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scan history</strong> — barcodes you scan and product information retrieved from Open Food Facts</li>
          <li><strong>Nutrition logs</strong> — meals and servings you manually log</li>
          <li><strong>User profile</strong> — dietary goals, restrictions, body stats, and preferences you enter</li>
          <li><strong>AI chat history</strong> — conversations with the AI nutrition partner</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping lists</strong> — items generated or added by you</li>
          <li><strong>Food rules</strong> — custom rules you create</li>
          <li><strong>Achievements</strong> — scan streaks and earned badges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.
          We do not have access to it, and it is not transmitted to our servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Data sent to third-party services</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Open Food Facts API</strong> — when you scan a barcode, we send the barcode number to 
            Open Food Facts (openfoodfacts.org) to retrieve product information. Open Food Facts is an 
            open-source, non-profit food database. See their{' '}

              privacy policy
            </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OpenAI API</strong> — AI chat messages, shopping list generation requests, and menu 
            analysis requests are sent to OpenAI's API for processing. These requests include the text 
            you provide and relevant context (dietary profile, food rules). OpenAI's data usage policy 
            applies. See{' '}

            </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Instacart API</strong> (optional) — if you use the "Order on Instacart" feature, your 
            shopping list items are sent to Instacart to create an order page. See{' '}

            </a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple HealthKit</strong> (optional) — if you enable HealthKit integration, nutrition 
            data from logged meals is written to Apple Health. We only write data; we do not read from 
            HealthKit. This data stays on your device and in your iCloud Health data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We use Cloudflare for security and performance, which may set essential cookies required for
          the proper functioning of our website (such as bot protection). We do not use tracking cookies
          or third-party analytics on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not collect personal identifying information (name, email, phone number)</li>
          <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs</li>

        <h2>Apple Health Data</h2>
        <p>
          If you grant HealthKit permissions, Ryva writes nutrition data (calories, macronutrients) 
          to Apple Health when you log meals. This data is governed by Apple's HealthKit privacy requirements. 
          We never use health data for advertising or share it with third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Ryva uses your camera to scan barcodes and photograph restaurant menus. Camera data is 
          processed on-device. Menu photos are processed locally using Apple's Vision framework for text 
          extraction. We do not store or transmit camera images.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Ryva is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
